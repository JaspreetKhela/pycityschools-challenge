# PyCitySchools Challenge

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to rectify a previous school district analysis where the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders were potentially forged; although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards by replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with 'NaN' values while keeping the rest of the data intact and then performing a school district analysis again. The analysis was performed using the Pandas package and covered:
* Creating a district summary DataFrame;
* Creating a school summary DataFrame;
* Determining the top 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rates;
* Determining the bottom 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rates;
* Determining the average math scores for each grade level from each school;
* Determining the average reading scores for each grade level from each school;
* Determining the scores by school spending per student;
* Determining the scores by school size; and
* Determining the scores by school type.

## Results
Overall, it can be seen from the results below that the new DataFrames with the modified ninth grade score for Thomas High School have not had a large impact on the results from our new analysis compared to the results from our previous analysis. We can compare the results from our original analysis with those from this new analysis by answering the questions below.

_____
* How is the district summary affected?
  * The average math score decreased by 0.1 and the passing percentages decreased by a similar amount after creating the new district summary. In otherwords, the changes made to the raw data did not have much of an impact on the analysis.

**Figure 4**: These are the math and reading scores by grade, school spending, school size, and school type.

_____
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  * Math and reading scores by grade
    * The math and reading scores for the tenth, elventh, and twelfth grades remain the same in the new analysis as they were in the old analysis.
  * Math and reading scores by school spending
    * There are no discernable differences in the math and reading scores by school spending between the old and new analysis scripts.
  * Math and reading scores by school size
    * There are differences in the math and reading scores by school size between the old and new analysis scripts, but these differences are neglible (e.g. differences in the tenths of a decimal number at most).
  * Math and reading scores by school type
    * There are no discernable differences in the math and reading scores by school type between the old and new analysis scripts.

## Summary
In summary, the impact of removing the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School from the analysis was neglible. However, the following four changes were noticed:
* The school district's average math and reading score decreased by a neglible amount;
* Thomas High School's math and reading score slightly decreased;
* Thomas High School's performance slightly increased - but its ranking stayed the same - amongst the district schools; and
* There was a neglible change in the math and reading scores by school size.
