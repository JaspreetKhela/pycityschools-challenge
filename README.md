## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to rectify a previous school district analysis where the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders were potentially forged; although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards by replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with 'NaN' values while keeping the rest of the data intact and then performing a school district analysis again. The analysis was performed using the Pandas package and covered:
* Creating a district summary DataFrame;
* Creating a school summary DataFrame;
* Determining the top 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rates;
* Determining the bottom 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rates;
* Determining the average math scores for each grade level from each school;
* Determining the average reading scores for each grade level from each school;
* Determining the scores by school spending per student;
* Determining the scores by school size; and
* Determining the scores by school type.
